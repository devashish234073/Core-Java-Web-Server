# Here:
# 1.mapGETHandler servers a GET request for url  pattern "/home" and points to the "html/home.html" file.
# 2.mapHandler serves the "/login" url pattern. And it points to LoginHandler class(where response is created) that extends HttpHandler class.
# 3.mapGETHandler serves the POST request for "/submitFeedback" url pattern.

These handlers are able to get the form data from a GET or POST request. And for doing that the variable can be enclosed within "${" and "}".
Example : to retrieve the data from textbox with name attribute as "uname" , the login.html can use ${uname}
